# Using Table Joins

Q1. Which top 3 mentors have the most Bitcoin quantity? Return the first_name of the mentors and sort the output from highest to lowest total_quantity

```sql
select m.first_name,
  sum(case when t.txn_type='SELL' then -t.quantity else t.quantity end) as total_quantity
from trading.members as m
join trading.transactions as t on
  t.member_id=m.member_id
where t.ticker='BTC'
group by m.first_name
order by total_quantity desc
limit 3;
```

Q2 .Show the market_date values which have less than 5 transactions? Sort the output in reverse chronological order.

```sql
select p.market_date,count(t.txn_id) as no_of_txn
from trading.prices as p
 left join trading.transactions as t on
  p.market_date=t.txn_date and p.ticker=t.ticker
group by p.market_date
having count(t.txn_id)<5
order by p.market_date desc;
```

Q3. For this question - we will generate a single table output which solves a multi-part problem about the dollar cost average of BTC purchases.

a. Part 1: Calculate the Dollar Cost Average

- What is the dollar cost average (btc_dca) for all Bitcoin purchases by region for each calendar year?
- Create a column called year_start and use the start of the calendar year
- The dollar cost average calculation is btc_dca = SUM(quantity x price) / SUM(quantity)

b. Part 2: Yearly Dollar Cost Average Ranking

- Use this btc_dca value to generate a dca_ranking column for each year
- The region with the lowest btc_dca each year has a rank of 1

c. Part 3: Dollar Cost Average Yearly Percentage Change

- Calculate the yearly percentage change in DCA for each region to 2 decimal places
- This calculation is (current - previous) / previous
- Finally order the output by region and year_start columns.

```sql
with part_one as
(
  select date_trunc('year',t.txn_date) as year_start, m.region,
    sum(t.quantity*p.price)/sum(t.quantity) as btc_dca
  from trading.transactions as t
  join trading.members as m on
    m.member_id=t.member_id
  join trading.prices as p on
    p.ticker=t.ticker and p.market_date=t.txn_date
  where t.ticker='BTC' and t.txn_type='BUY'
  group by year_start,m.region  
),
part_two as
(
  select year_start,region,btc_dca,rank() over(partition by year_start order by btc_dca asc) as dca_ranking
  from part_one
  group by year_start,region,btc_dca
),
part_three as
(
  select year_start,region,dca_ranking,btc_dca,lag(btc_dca) over(partition by year_start order by btc_dca asc) 
    as previous_dca
  from part_two
  group by year_start,region,btc_dca,dca_ranking
)
select year_start,region,dca_ranking,btc_dca,previous_dca,round((100*(btc_dca-previous_dca)/previous_dca)::numeric,2)
  as dca_percentage_change
from part_three
group by year_start,region,btc_dca,dca_ranking,previous_dca
order by year_start,region,dca_ranking;
```

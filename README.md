# ðŸ’¸ Cryptocurrency Case Study

#### Introduction

In our fictitious case study - Danny's data mentors from the Data With Danny team have been busy trading cryptocurrency markets since 2017.

Our main purpose for this case study is to analyze the performance of the DWD mentors over time. We will accomplish this by writing SQL queries to utilize all available datasets to answer a series of realistic business questions

***

#### Our Available Datasets

All of our data for this case study exists within the trading schema in our PostgreSQL database.

There are 3 data tables available to us in this schema which we can use to run our SQL queries with:

1. members

2. prices

3. transactions

# Understanding CASE WHEN Statements

Q1. Convert the volume column in the trading.prices table with an adjusted integer value to take into the unit values
- Return only the market_date, price, volume and adjusted_volume columns for the first 10 days of August 2021 for Ethereum only

```sql
select market_date,price,volume,
  case when right(volume,1)='K' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*1000
       when right(volume,1)='M' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*100000
       else 0
  end as adjusted_volume
from trading.prices
where market_date between '2021-08-01' and '2021-08-10' and ticker='ETH'

Q2. How many "breakout" days were there in 2020 where the price column is greater than the open column for each ticker?
- In the same query also calculate the number of "non breakout" days where the price column was lower than or equal to the open column.

```sql
select ticker,
  sum(case when price>open then 1 else 0 end) as breadkout_days,
  sum(case when price<open then 1 else 0 end) as non_breakout_days
from trading.prices
where date_part('year',market_date)=2020
group by ticker;
```

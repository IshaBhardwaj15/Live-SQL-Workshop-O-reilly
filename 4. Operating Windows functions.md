Q1. What are the market_date, price and volume and price_rank values for the days with the top 5 highest price values for each 
- tickers in the trading.prices table? The price_rank column is the ranking for price values for each ticker with rank = 1 for the highest value.
- Return the output for Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum in price rank order.

```sql
with cte as
(
  select ticker,market_date,price,volume,
    rank() over(partition by ticker order by price desc) as price_rank
  from trading.prices
  group by ticker,market_date,price,volume
  order by ticker
)
select * from cte
where price_rank<=5
group by ticker,market_date,price,volume,price_rank
order by ticker,price desc;
```

Q2. Calculate a 7 day rolling average for the price and volume columns in the trading.prices table for each ticker.
- Return only the first 10 days of August 2021

```sql
with volume as
(
  select ticker,market_date,price,
    case when right(volume,1)='K' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*1000
         when right(volume,1)='M' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*1000000
         else 0
    end as new_volume
  from trading.prices
  where market_date between '2021-08-01' and '2021-08-10'
  group by ticker,market_date,price,new_volume
),
moving_avg_price as
(
  select ticker,market_date,new_volume,price,
    avg(price) over(partition by ticker order by market_date range between '7 DAYS' preceding and current row)
    as moving_avg_price
  from volume
  group by ticker,market_date,price,new_volume,price
)
select ticker,market_date,moving_avg_price,new_volume,
  avg(new_volume) over(partition by ticker order by market_date range between '7 DAYS' preceding and current row)
    as moving_avg_volume
from moving_avg_price
group by ticker,market_date,moving_avg_price,new_volume;
```

Q3. Calculate the monthly cumulative volume traded for each ticker in 2020
- Sort the output by ticker in chronological order with the month_start as the first day of each month

```sql
with cte as
(
  select ticker,date_trunc('month',market_date) as month_start,
    sum(case when right(volume,1)='K' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*1000
           when right(volume,1)='M' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*1000000
           else 0
      end) as new_volume
  from trading.prices
  where date_part('year',market_date)=2020
  group by ticker,month_start
)
select ticker,month_start,
  sum(new_volume) over(partition by ticker order by month_start range between unbounded preceding and current row)
  as cumulative_monthly_volume
from cte
group by ticker,month_start,new_volume;
```

Q4. Calculate the daily percentage change in volume for each ticker in the trading.prices table
- Percentage change can be calculated as (current - previous) / previous
- Multiply the percentage by 100 and round the value to 2 decimal places
- Return data for the first 10 days of August 2021

```sql
with cte as
(
  select ticker,market_date,
    case when right(volume,1)='K' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*1000
             when right(volume,1)='M' then left(volume,LENGTH(volume)-1)::numeric*1000000
             else 0
        end as volume
  from trading.prices
  where market_date between '2021-08-01' and '2021-08-10'
  group by ticker,market_date,volume
),
ctee as
(
  select ticker,market_date,volume,lag(volume) over(partition by ticker order by market_date)
  as previous_volume
  from cte
  where volume<>0
  group by ticker,market_date,volume
)
select ticker,market_date,volume,previous_volume,round((((volume-previous_volume)/previous_volume)*100),2)
  as daily_change
from ctee
group by ticker,market_date,volume,previous_volume;
```
